## Notes

- When invoked from Cargo builds the CLI will normally detect the manifest dir; if you run the installed binary from other locations, you can influence where the workspace root is discovered with the `OXDOCK_WORKSPACE_ROOT` environment variable.
- The CLI uses the same DSL and runtime as the `oxdock-core` crate; it sets a separate `CARGO_TARGET_DIR` for nested cargo invocations to avoid collisions with the outer build.

Integration with compile-time macros
- For compile-time embedding, see `oxdock-macros::oxdock_embed!` which runs the same DSL during `build.rs`/proc-macro time and produces an `out_dir` whose files are embedded directly into a generated struct (no additional runtime dependencies).

Examples
See the repository `examples/` folder for sample scripts and an `embed_demo.rs` that demonstrates how the compile-time macro and CLI work together.
